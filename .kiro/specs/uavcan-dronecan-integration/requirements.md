# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating UAVCAN/DroneCAN protocol support into the existing STM32H723 CycloneTCP test platform. The integration will enable the device to participate in UAVCAN/DroneCAN networks over UDP transport, providing both node functionality and diagnostic capabilities through the existing command console interface.

UAVCAN/DroneCAN is a lightweight protocol designed for reliable communication in applications like unmanned vehicles, robotics, and aerospace systems. The integration will leverage the existing libudpard library and CycloneTCP stack to provide a complete UAVCAN/DroneCAN node implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize and configure a UAVCAN/DroneCAN node, so that the device can participate in UAVCAN networks with proper node identification and transport configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the UAVCAN node SHALL be initialized with a configurable node ID
2. WHEN the UAVCAN node is initialized THEN it SHALL configure UDP transport using the existing CycloneTCP stack
3. WHEN the node ID is not configured THEN the system SHALL use dynamic node ID allocation
4. IF the network interface is not ready THEN the UAVCAN initialization SHALL wait for network connectivity
5. WHEN initialization completes THEN the system SHALL log the node status and configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to send and receive UAVCAN/DroneCAN messages, so that the device can communicate with other nodes in the network for data exchange and control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a UAVCAN message is received THEN the system SHALL process it according to the message type and subject ID
2. WHEN the application needs to publish data THEN it SHALL create and send UAVCAN messages with proper formatting
3. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL handle message serialization using the DSDL definitions
4. WHEN receiving messages THEN the system SHALL deserialize and validate message content
5. WHEN message transmission fails THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic and error handling
6. WHEN multiple messages are queued for transmission THEN the system SHALL prioritize them according to UAVCAN/Cyphal UDP priority rules
7. WHEN higher priority messages are available THEN they SHALL be transmitted before lower priority messages
8. WHEN implementing message prioritization THEN the system SHALL follow the Cyphal/UDP standard priority mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to monitor UAVCAN/DroneCAN network activity and node status, so that I can diagnose network issues and verify proper operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the command console THEN users SHALL be able to view current node status and statistics
2. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL display received messages with timestamps and source information
3. WHEN requested through commands THEN the system SHALL show network topology and discovered nodes
4. WHEN diagnostic mode is active THEN the system SHALL log detailed protocol-level information
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and diagnostic information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure UAVCAN/DroneCAN parameters through the command interface, so that I can adjust node behavior and network settings without recompiling firmware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using console commands THEN users SHALL be able to set the node ID
2. WHEN configuring transport THEN users SHALL be able to modify UDP port and multicast settings
3. WHEN changing parameters THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values before applying them
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL reject them with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL take effect immediately or after node restart as appropriate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the UAVCAN/DroneCAN implementation to coexist with existing functionality, so that adding UAVCAN support doesn't interfere with current TCP/IP operations and command console features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UAVCAN services are running THEN existing HTTP client functionality SHALL continue to work normally
2. WHEN using the command console THEN both serial and Telnet interfaces SHALL remain fully functional
3. WHEN UAVCAN traffic is active THEN it SHALL not significantly impact other network operations
4. WHEN system resources are allocated THEN UAVCAN tasks SHALL use appropriate priority levels to avoid blocking critical operations
5. WHEN errors occur in UAVCAN subsystem THEN they SHALL not crash or destabilize the main application
6. WHEN the CycloneTCP stack operates THEN it SHALL run in its own dedicated task with thread-safe interfaces
7. WHEN multiple network protocols are active THEN the TCP/IP stack SHALL safely handle concurrent access from Telnet, UAVCAN/UDP, and other network traffic
8. WHEN accessing network resources THEN all components SHALL use proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a UAVCAN network participant, I want the node to send periodic heartbeat messages, so that other nodes can detect my presence and monitor my health status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UAVCAN node is active THEN it SHALL send heartbeat messages at regular intervals (typically 1 Hz)
2. WHEN sending heartbeat messages THEN they SHALL include current node health status and operational mode
3. WHEN the node health changes THEN the next heartbeat message SHALL reflect the updated status
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN heartbeat transmission SHALL continue when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN the heartbeat interval is configurable THEN it SHALL be adjustable through console commands within valid UAVCAN limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want to send test messages and simulate UAVCAN/DroneCAN scenarios, so that I can verify the implementation and test interoperability with other UAVCAN devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using test commands THEN the system SHALL be able to send predefined test messages
2. WHEN in test mode THEN the system SHALL generate periodic test messages with configurable content
3. WHEN simulating scenarios THEN the system SHALL support sending various message types with configurable parameters
4. WHEN testing interoperability THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to standard UAVCAN service requests
5. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of all UAVCAN protocol interactions
