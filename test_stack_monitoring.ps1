.SYNOPSIS
    Test FreeRTOS Stack Monitoring CLI Commands
    
.DESCRIPTION
    This script tests the newly implemented stack monitoring CLI commands
    to help debug the suspected stack overflow issue.
    
.PARAMETER ComPort
    Serial port to use for communication (default: COM3)
    
.PARAMETER TelnetIP
    IP address for telnet connection (default: 192.168.0.20)
    
.PARAMETER TelnetPort
    Port for telnet connection (default: 23)
    
.PARAMETER UseSerial
    Use serial connection instead of telnet
    
.EXAMPLE
    .\test_stack_monitoring.ps1
    .\test_stack_monitoring.ps1 -UseSerial
    .\test_stack_monitoring.ps1 -ComPort COM4
