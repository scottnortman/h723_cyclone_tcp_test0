## Executive Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED AND VERIFIED ON HARDWARE**

The STM32H723 UAVCAN/DroneCAN integration project has successfully completed comprehensive development, debugging, and optimization phases. All identified issues have been systematically resolved and verified through extensive Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing on actual hardware.

**System Status:** âœ… **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

---

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. âœ… **CLI Buffer Truncation Issue**

**Problem:** CLI commands were truncated at 128 bytes, causing incomplete output  
**Root Cause:** Insufficient CLI buffer size in FreeRTOS-Plus-CLI configuration  
**Solution:** Increased CLI buffer from 128 to 512 bytes  
**Verification:** All CLI commands now output complete text with end markers  
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED AND VERIFIED**

### 2. âœ… **Stack Overflow Hardware Freezing**

**Problem:** Hardware freezing during operation, suspected stack overflow  
**Root Cause:** Insufficient FreeRTOS task stack allocations  
**Solution:** Systematically increased all task stack sizes based on actual usage  
**Verification:** Hardware stable, no freezing, continuous operation confirmed  
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED AND VERIFIED**

### 3. âœ… **Stack Info Command Parsing Issues**

**Problem:** Stack monitoring command showing incorrect data interpretation  
**Root Cause:** Misunderstanding of FreeRTOS high water mark values  
**Solution:** Fixed stack usage calculations (high water mark = free space remaining)  
**Verification:** Command now shows accurate task information with correct usage percentages  
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED AND VERIFIED**

### 4. âœ… **Memory Warnings and Optimization**

**Problem:** Multiple tasks showing WARNING status (>75% stack usage)  
**Root Cause:** Conservative initial stack allocations insufficient for actual usage  
**Solution:** Optimized heap (32KBâ†’64KB) and stack allocations based on measured usage  
**Verification:** All tasks now in OK status with healthy usage levels (<50%)  
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED AND VERIFIED**
