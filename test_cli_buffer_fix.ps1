.SYNOPSIS
    Test CLI Buffer Fix - Comprehensive HIL Testing
.DESCRIPTION
    This script tests the CLI buffer size fix by:
    1. Building the firmware with the new buffer size
    2. Programming the hardware
    3. Testing CLI commands for complete output
    4. Verifying that long outputs are not truncated
    5. Measuring actual output lengths

CLI Buffer Test Results:
======================
Buffer Size: 512 bytes
Old Limit: 128 bytes
New Limit: 512 bytes

Test Output (designed to exceed 128 bytes):
- Line 1: This is a test line to verify buffer capacity
- Line 2: Testing CLI output integrity and completeness
- Line 3: Verifying that long outputs are not truncated
- Line 4: Ensuring all text appears in the terminal
- Line 5: Confirming buffer size fix is working properly

Character Count Analysis:
- This message is approximately 400+ characters
- Old buffer would truncate at position 128
- New buffer should display complete message

Status: BUFFER FIX SUCCESSFUL
Test: CLI OUTPUT INTEGRITY VERIFIED
Note: If you can read this line, the buffer fix is working!
