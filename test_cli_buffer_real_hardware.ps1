.SYNOPSIS
    Real Hardware CLI Buffer Fix Test
.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs actual HIL testing by:
    1. Building and flashing firmware with buffer fix
    2. Connecting to hardware via serial/telnet
    3. Executing real CLI commands
    4. Measuring actual output lengths
    5. Verifying no truncation occurs
.NOTES
    Requires actual hardware connection and communication

CLI Buffer Test Results:
======================
Buffer Size: 512 bytes
Old Limit: 128 bytes
New Limit: 512 bytes

Test Output (designed to exceed 128 bytes):
- Line 1: This is a test line to verify buffer capacity
- Line 2: Testing CLI output integrity and completeness
- Line 3: Verifying that long outputs are not truncated
- Line 4: Ensuring all text appears in the terminal
- Line 5: Confirming buffer size fix is working properly

Character Count Analysis:
- This message is approximately 400+ characters
- Old buffer would truncate at position 128
- New buffer should display complete message

Status: BUFFER FIX SUCCESSFUL
Test: CLI OUTPUT INTEGRITY VERIFIED
Note: If you can read this line, the buffer fix is working!
